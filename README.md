# Avoid the `Cone of Shame` by securing application delivery pipelines from the beginning

## TL;DR
Use HashiCorp Packer v1.7.x with the new HCL2 templates to consistently and securely build, configure and test pipeline images for the VMware ecosystem, VMware ESXi 7.x & vCentre Server Appliance 7.x. The same principles used with VMware in this example can be tweaked for other cloud platforms such as AWS, GCP, Azure, AliCloud, Oracle Cloud and Vagrant, to name a few.

## Key Take Aways
1. Always disable username/password access over the network at the start of your pipeline by default and ensure to leverage ssh with secret key pairs as a minimium. 

Inject a public ssh key for your image builder account at image creation time and disable network authentication via password access - from the `preseed.cfg` file in this repo the configuration looks like this

```Shell 
d-i preseed/late_command string \
    in-target sed -i 's/^%sudo.*$/%sudo ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL/g' /etc/sudoers; \
    in-target /bin/sh -c "echo 'Defaults env_keep += \"SSH_AUTH_SOCK\"' >> /etc/sudoers"; \
    in-target mkdir -p /home/iac4me/.ssh; \
    in-target /bin/sh -c "echo 'ssh-rsa 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 iac4me-BASTIONUSER-USER-KEY' >> /home/iac4me/.ssh/authorized_keys"; \
    in-target chown -R iac4me:iac4me /home/iac4me/; \
    in-target chmod -R go-rwx /home/iac4me/.ssh/authorized_keys; \
    in-target sed -i 's/PermitRootLogin yes/PermitRootLogin no/g' /etc/ssh/sshd_config; \
    in-target sed -i 's/#PasswordAuthentication yes/PasswordAuthentication no/g' /etc/ssh/sshd_config;
```

This configuration information will vary depending on the Operating System (OS) being installed - it's using the native OS installer, in this case it's Ubuntu 18.x
Don't forget to update the login details used by Packer during the build process in the HCL file - `example.pkr.hcl`

```Hcl
  ssh_private_key_file = "/Users/grazzer/.ssh/iac4me-id_rsa"
  ssh_username = "iac4me"
```

Note: If working at scale and you'd prefer to avoid the overhead of ssh key management consider switching to Certificate based authentication discussed previously in this [blog post](https://allthingscloud.eu/2020/01/05/ssh-certificate-based-authentication-a-quick-guide/)

2. Test the base images for compliance as you create them - why wait until you're in production to check for vulnerabilities and non compliance - don't let them escape out there to begin with.

`Shift left` mindset for security and compliance - bring these teams in early by building compliance and governance into your pipeline from the outset.


## Introduction
It's almost a daily occurence to learn about another big data breach with many millions of user details accidentally leaked or stolen.
We are no longer surprised by these events, however it doesn't mean that we should let complacency set in. Governments are starting to focus on these data breaches, providing recommendations and best practise guidance in some cases but in all cases [fines and penalities are also increasing significantly](https://www.theregister.com/2021/07/30/amazon_european_privacy_fine/). 

Unfortunately it's the latter that tends to drive good behaviour in business. I recall sitting in a C level meeting with a global corporation in the late 90's in London, demonstrating some compliance software. When it came to the commercial discussion the customer used the size of the fine for non-compliance factored with the probability of actually being discovered in the first place as key decision criteria as to whether or not they would invest in the software.

The more recent SolarWinds supply chain hack exposed publically in October 2020, which at the time of writing this article in August 2021 is still impacting many businesses, is yet another example of why the classical `Castle and Moate` pattern, used by companies to protect their IT environments, has become seriously flawed. We are still relying predominantly on firewalls and VPNs to protect the perimiters of our data centres and then assuming everyone inside this circle of trust is a good citizen! Don't get me wrong here, firewals, VPNs etc. all have a role to play but there's a lot more that we can do today.

This article focuses on the beginning of a more modern application delivery workflow  - the phoenix build process for an immutable pipeline. A lot of words which basically boils down to building, configuring and testing the base images at the start of your application delivery pipeline rather than reconfiguring and updating existing applications. If you're still struggling to find a window of time to apply the latest round of patches to your production environment it's time to start looking at these new patterns. It only takes minutes for a published zero day vulnerability to be weaponised and targeted towards these legacy server farms. Why are we still operating this way!

When an Operating System patch needs to be delivered, or an application release deployed these changes are implemented via a new base image, this image then goes through Development and User Acceptance Testing, and once successful, will finally being rolled out to Production. Modern schedulers like Kubernetes or Nomad provide advanced application delivery workflows that help maintaining application availability when switching out the old application and bringing the new application online. Rollback can be fast too, when required, as a result of the immutable approach of this delivery pipeline.

HashiCorp makes a very powerful and useful open source tool known as Packer, which is designed for use at the start of this modern application delivery workflow. It can be used to automatically and consistently build repeatable base images that can then be consumed by the next phase of the application workflow. Much of the cloud native industry has already embraced Packer as their defacto tool for this process. However, I often see pipelines where security has been omitted through convenience at the start of this process. The purpose of the rest of this article will be to provide a few tips and tricks on deploying new images using ssh keys rather than passwords and also adding testing to the base image to help drive compliance. It's much cheaper to fix a bug at the start of this pipeline than when it's in production. Everything mentioned here comes out of the box with Packer - it just not always implemented by teams. 

I rebuilt the VMware test platform this weekend and will share a `warts and all` attempt at building an image I did have working in January. Everything that I show here on VMware can be easily adapted for AWS, Azure, GCP, etc. If time permits I'll drop other examples in this [repo](https://github.com/allthingsclowd/packer-vsphere) at a later date.


I used Packer version 1.7.4 in this example.

## The steps that I took

- Let's quickly install HashiCorp Packer, I'm using MacOS (Intel based) for the demo
- First, I'll ensure the HashiCorp Homebrew tap is installed, this tap includes all HashiCorp products not just Packer.
```Shell
$ brew tap hashicorp/tap
```

- Install Packer on MacOS. Please see the [HashiCorp Learn Website](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/packer/getting-started-install) for more comprehensive details.
```Shell

$ brew install hashicorp/tap/packer

==> Installing packer from hashicorp/tap
==> Downloading https://releases.hashicorp.com/packer/1.7.4/packer_1.7.4_darwin_amd64.zip
######################################################################## 100.0%
üç∫  /usr/local/Cellar/packer/1.7.4: 3 files, 161.4MB, built in 6 seconds
```

- Verify Packer has been installed as follows
```Shell
$ packer version
Packer v1.7.4
```

- Grab the [repo here](https://github.com/allthingsclowd/packer-vsphere) if you wish to follow along with this walk through
```Shell

$ git clone git@github.com:allthingsclowd/packer-vsphere.git

```

- Let's quickly check that I've created a valid packer HCL template file

```

- Whoops, don't forget to source your environment variables once you've correctly configured them to align with your environmental setup. Ensure to change the defaults in the `var.env` file. Off we go again..


```Shell
$ source var.env
$ packer validate example.pkr.hcl
Error: Unset variable "vcentre_password"

A used variable must be set or have a default value; see
https://packer.io/docs/templates/hcl_templates/syntax for details.

Error: Unset variable "vcentre_host"

Error: Unset variable "vcentre_user"

A used variable must be set or have a default value; see
https://packer.io/docs/templates/hcl_templates/syntax for details.
```

- You didn't really think I'd have the passwords in the `var.env` file in my github repo - did you?
I need to pull these in as environment variables too. You will also need to configure these  secret environment variables to match your environment, please don't put them in your repo it's not a good practise. (We do offer [HashiCorp Vault](https://learn.hashicorp.com/vault) for managing such secret material but that post is for another day)

Outside of this repository I have the following secrets file that is also `source`d to configure the required environment variables...

```Shell
# vCenter Setup
export PKR_VAR_vcentre_user="<my vcentre account>@vsphere.local"
export PKR_VAR_vcentre_password="<my vcentre password>"
export PKR_VAR_vcentre_host="vCentre IP Address"
export PKR_VAR_esx_host="ESX IP Address"

```

- Once the `var.env` file and the `secrets` file have both been sourced (all prerequisited environment variables set in memory) the packer validation will succeed ... boringly without any notification as follows

```Shell
$ packer validate example.pkr.hcl
$
```

- So, let's go for it!
- The configuration has passed it's Packer validation so that's it right?
- 1, 2, 3 and we're off...

```Shell
$ packer build example.pkr.hcl
```

- Packer has been configured to use Chef's Inspec to test my packer build process but a recent Zoom challenge forced a laptop rebuild during a frustrated debug session and I have not automated my laptop rebuild process. I need to re-install Chef as the Inspec testing runs from the build server (my laptop)

- Okay, bare with me - this error is more on topic. Once the image was built Packer then kicked off the Inspec tests to ensure the image build is compliant. It's not! It turns out that the Envoy Proxy team may have changed how their software can be deployed since I last ran their installation script.

==> Some builds didn't complete successfully and had errors:
```

- Basically what's happening now is my post build testing, all part of the packer build process, has detected an error with one of the binaries that should be on this image, it's missing!!! This is exactly why we use ephemeral builds and test before we ever get into production - it's much cheaper for businesses to make these mistakes earlier in the delivery process.

- It looks like the envoyproxy installation process has changed since this build was last run successfully in January

```Shell
==> vsphere-iso.example: /tmp/script_4250.sh: line 128: getenvoy: command not found
==> vsphere-iso.example: chmod: cannot access '/usr/local/bin/getenvoy': No such file or directory
==> vsphere-iso.example: /tmp/script_4250.sh: line 130: /usr/local/bin/getenvoy: No such file or directory
==> vsphere-iso.example: cp: cannot stat '/usr/local/bin/builds/standard/1.17.0/linux_glibc/bin/envoy': No such file or directory

==> vsphere-iso.example: /tmp/script_4250.sh: line 133: /usr/local/bin/envoy: No such file or directory
```

- So, I cheated a little here in the interest of time and have removed the test for envoy proxy binary from the `vmware_example_image.rb` file until such a time as I have an opportunity to debug it's installation script.

```Ruby
# control 'envoy-exists-1.0' do         
#   impact 1.0                      
#   title 'envoy software exists'
#   desc 'verify that envoy is installed'
#   describe file('/usr/local/bin/envoy') do 
#     it { should exist }
#   end
# end

# control 'envoy-version-1.0' do                      
#   impact 1.0                                
#   title 'envoy version check'
#   desc 'verify that envoy is the correct version'
#   describe command('/usr/local/bin/envoy --version') do
#    its('stdout') { should match envoy_version }
#   end
# end

```

- And off we go again...

- Basically another cautious tail when working with Packer and Git repositories...setup your `.gitignore` file before commiting anything. When Packer runs it caches the images that you call out for in your configuration file. We don't want these in our git repository (usually). 
- To avoid this error remember to create and configure a `.gitignore` file at the start of your image building process and as a minimium place the packer_cache directory in it. 
- To fix this issue I use a handy tool called [BFG](https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/) as follows

- So, I fixed the repository I broke, let's go again...

```

- By default Packer cleans up after itself when it throws an error. However, when debugging an installation script (envoy proxy above) it's often helpful to prevent this cleanup operation so that we can login to the server and manually investigate.

- This mode of operation is invoked by using the `-on-error` flag as follows

```Shell
$ packer build -on-error=abort example.pkr.hcl
```

- However, we got the previous error when restarting the build because Packer quickly detected the previous run was not cleaned up correctly.
- We can push past this by leveraging the `-force` flag

- And now we're back on track...

```Shell
packer build -on-error=abort -force example.pkr.hcl

- What? 
- No Waaaaaaaay!
- Waaaaay!

- Missing VMware Tools!!! This is a surprise, last time I looked I'm sure it was installed.

- Quick fix here is to simply ensure VMware Tools is added to the prerequisites in the installation script `packer_install_base_packages.sh`

`sudo apt-get install -y -q wget tmux unzip git redis-server nginx lynx jq curl net-tools open-vm-tools`

- And don't forget to test for it, of course, by adding the following to the Inspec test file

```Ruby
  describe package('open-vm-tools') do
    it {should be_installed}
  end
```

- And finally we get a new template deployed to my ESX host

- Hopefully this repository and readme is useful to someone else on this interweb thingy.

Happy Automating,
Graz

## To Do
- Add more image platform examples
- Fix base binary deployment of envoyproxy
- Possibly add Travis testing too, see what I can do just in the cloud with no local Macbook required
